# riscwin

Open a window on RISC OS

This will be a graphics window (for 2D animations) with a text overlay.

- The text overlay will contain a simple single screen editor workspace for interactive commands.
- The graphics layer will be built from a display list of 2d graphic and sprite commands.
- The graphics and text will be displayed in the window using an offscreen bitmap.
